# unit-4-game

    *Directions*
    
	  There are four crystals below. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.
    
    You win the game by matching your total score to random number.
    
    You will lose the game if your total score goes above the number you have to reach.
    
    The actual value of each crystal is hidden so you have to keep track of what the crystals individually equal to reach your total score.
    
    Each time the game starts, each crystals value will be changed to a new numerical number.
